üöë **Critical fix**

- This version reintroduces the deprecated `BigInteger::parse()` method, that has been removed by mistake in version `0.8.9` and should have lasted for the whole `0.8` release cycle.

üêõ **Fixes**

- added missing `ext-json` requirement, due to `BigNumber` implementing `JsonSerializable`

‚ö°Ô∏è **Optimizations**

- additional optimization in `BigInteger::remainder()`

## [0.8.14](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.14) - 2020-02-18

‚ú® **New features**

- `BigInteger::getLowestSetBit()` returns the index of the rightmost one bit

## [0.8.13](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.13) - 2020-02-16

## [0.8.12](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.12) - 2020-02-03

üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance release**

Classes are now annotated for better static analysis with [psalm](https://psalm.dev/).

This is a maintenance release: no bug fixes, no new features, no breaking changes.

## [0.8.11](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.11) - 2020-01-23

‚ú® **New feature**

`BigInteger::powerMod()` performs a power-with-modulo operation. Useful for crypto.

## [0.8.10](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.10) - 2020-01-21

‚ú® **New feature**

`BigInteger::mod()` returns the **modulo** of two numbers. The *modulo* differs from the *remainder* when the signs of the operands are different.

## [0.8.9](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.9) - 2020-01-08

‚ö°Ô∏è **Performance improvements**

A few additional optimizations in `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal` when one of the operands can be returned as is. Thanks to @tomtomsen in #24.

## [0.8.8](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.8) - 2019-04-25

üêõ **Bug fixes**

- `BigInteger::toBase()` could return an empty string for zero values (BCMath & Native calculators only, GMP calculator unaffected)

‚ú® **New features**

- `BigInteger::toArbitraryBase()` converts a number to an arbitrary base, using a custom alphabet
- `BigInteger::fromArbitraryBase()` converts a string in an arbitrary base, using a custom alphabet, back to a number

These methods can be used as the foundation to convert strings between different bases/alphabets, using BigInteger as an intermediate representation.

üí© **Deprecations**

- `BigInteger::parse()` is now deprecated in favour of `fromBase()`

`BigInteger::fromBase()` works the same way as `parse()`, with 2 minor differences:

- the `$base` parameter is required, it does not default to `10`
- it throws a `NumberFormatException` instead of an `InvalidArgumentException` when the number is malformed

## [0.8.7](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.7) - 2019-04-20

**Improvements**

- Safer conversion from `float` when using custom locales
- **Much faster** `NativeCalculator` implementation üöÄ

You can expect **at least a 3x performance improvement** for common arithmetic operations when using the library on systems without GMP or BCMath; it gets exponentially faster on multiplications with a high number of digits. This is due to calculations now being performed on whole blocks of digits (the block size depending on the platform, 32-bit or 64-bit) instead of digit-by-digit as before.

## [0.8.6](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.6) - 2019-04-11

**New method**

`BigNumber::sum()` returns the sum of one or more numbers.

## [0.8.5](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.5) - 2019-02-12

**Bug fix**: `of()` factory methods could fail when passing a `float` in environments using a `LC_NUMERIC` locale with a decimal separator other than `'.'` (#20).

Thanks @manowark üëç

## [0.8.4](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.4) - 2018-12-07

**New method**

`BigDecimal::sqrt()` calculates the square root of a decimal number, to a given scale.

## [0.8.3](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.3) - 2018-12-06

**New method**

`BigInteger::sqrt()` calculates the square root of a number (thanks @peter279k).

**New exception**

`NegativeNumberException` is thrown when calling `sqrt()` on a negative number.

## [0.8.2](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.2) - 2018-11-08

**Performance update**

- Further improvement of `toInt()` performance
- `NativeCalculator` can now perform some multiplications more efficiently

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.1) - 2018-11-07

Performance optimization of `toInt()` methods.

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.8.0) - 2018-10-13

**Breaking changes**

The following deprecated methods have been removed. Use the new method name instead:

| Method removed | Replacement method |
| --- | --- |
| `BigDecimal::getIntegral()` | `BigDecimal::getIntegralPart()` |
| `BigDecimal::getFraction()` | `BigDecimal::getFractionalPart()` |

---

**New features**

`BigInteger` has been augmented with 5 new methods for bitwise operations:

| New method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `and()` | performs a bitwise `AND` operation on two numbers |
| `or()` | performs a bitwise `OR` operation on two numbers |
| `xor()` | performs a bitwise `XOR` operation on two numbers |
| `shiftedLeft()` | returns the number shifted left by a number of bits |
| `shiftedRight()` | returns the number shifted right by a number of bits |

Thanks to @DASPRiD üëç

## [0.7.3](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.7.3) - 2018-08-20

## [0.7.2](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.7.2) - 2018-07-21

**Performance update**

`BigInteger::parse()` and `toBase()` now use GMP's built-in base conversion features when available.

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.7.1) - 2018-03-01

This is a maintenance release, no code has been changed.

`ArithmeticException` has been deprecated, and will be removed in 0.7.0.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.6.1) - 2017-10-02

A number of methods have been renamed:

The old methods will be removed in version 0.7.0.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.6.0) - 2017-08-25

- Minimum PHP version is now [7.1](https://gophp71.org/); for PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 support, use version `0.5`

`BigNumber` classes now implement [JsonSerializable](http://php.net/manual/en/class.jsonserializable.php).
The JSON output is always a string.

## [0.5.3](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.5.3) - 2016-03-31

This is a bugfix release. Dividing by a negative power of 1 with the same scale as the dividend could trigger an incorrect optimization which resulted in a wrong result. See #6.

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.5.2) - 2015-08-06

The `$scale` parameter of `BigDecimal::dividedBy()` is now optional again.

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.5.1) - 2015-07-05

**New method: `BigNumber::toScale()`**

This allows to convert any `BigNumber` to a `BigDecimal` with a given scale, using rounding if necessary.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/brick/math/releases/tag/0.5.0) - 2015-07-04

**New features**
- Common `BigNumber` interface for all classes, with the following methods:
  - `sign()` and derived methods (`isZero()`, `isPositive()`, ...)
  - `compareTo()` and derived methods (`isEqualTo()`, `isGreaterThan()`, ...) that work across different `BigNumber` types
  - `toBigInteger()`, `toBigDecimal()`, `toBigRational`() conversion methods
  - `toInteger()` and `toFloat()` conversion methods to native types
- Unified `of()` behaviour: every class now accepts any type of number, provided that it can be safely converted to the current type
- New method: `BigDecimal::exactlyDividedBy()`; this method automatically computes the scale of the result, provided that the division yields a finite number of digits
- New methods: `BigRational::quotient()` and `remainder()`
- Fine-grained exceptions: `DivisionByZeroException`, `RoundingNecessaryException`, `NumberFormatException`
- Factory methods `zero()`, `one()` and `ten()` available in all classes
- Rounding mode reintroduced in `BigInteger::dividedBy()`

This release also comes with many performance improvements.

Backport of two bug fixes from the 0.5 branch:
- `BigInteger::parse()` did not always throw `InvalidArgumentException` as expected

Backport of two bug fixes from the 0.5 branch:

- `BigInteger::parse()` did not always throw `InvalidArgumentException` as expected
- Dividing by a negative power of 1 with the same scale as the dividend could trigger an incorrect optimization which resulted in a wrong result. See #6.
