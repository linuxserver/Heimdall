# Doctrine Deprecations

A small (side-effect free by default) layer on top of
`trigger_error(E_USER_DEPRECATED)` or PSR-3 logging.

- no side-effects by default, making it a perfect fit for libraries that don't know how the error handler works they operate under
- options to avoid having to rely on error handlers global state by using PSR-3 logging
- deduplicate deprecation messages to avoid excessive triggering and reduce overhead

We recommend to collect Deprecations using a PSR logger instead of relying on
the global error handler.

## Usage from consumer perspective:

Enable Doctrine deprecations to be sent to a PSR3 logger:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::enableWithPsrLogger($logger);
```

Enable Doctrine deprecations to be sent as `@trigger_error($message, E_USER_DEPRECATED)`
messages.

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::enableWithTriggerError();
```

If you only want to enable deprecation tracking, without logging or calling `trigger_error` then call:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::enableTrackingDeprecations();
```

Tracking is enabled with all three modes and provides access to all triggered
deprecations and their individual count:

```php
$deprecations = \Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::getTriggeredDeprecations();

foreach ($deprecations as $identifier => $count) {
    echo $identifier . " was triggered " . $count . " times\n";
}
```

### Suppressing Specific Deprecations

Disable triggering about specific deprecations:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::ignoreDeprecations("https://link/to/deprecations-description-identifier");
```

Disable all deprecations from a package

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::ignorePackage("doctrine/orm");
```

### Other Operations

When used within PHPUnit or other tools that could collect multiple instances of the same deprecations
the deduplication can be disabled:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::withoutDeduplication();
```

Disable deprecation tracking again:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::disable();
```

## Usage from a library/producer perspective:

When you want to unconditionally trigger a deprecation even when called
from the library itself then the `trigger` method is the way to go:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::trigger(
    "doctrine/orm",
    "https://link/to/deprecations-description",
    "message"
);
```

If variable arguments are provided at the end, they are used with `sprintf` on
the message.

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::trigger(
    "doctrine/orm",
    "https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issue/1234",
    "message %s %d",
    "foo",
    1234
);
```

When you want to trigger a deprecation only when it is called by a function
outside of the current package, but not trigger when the package itself is the cause,
then use:

```php
\Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation::triggerIfCalledFromOutside(
    "doctrine/orm",
    "https://link/to/deprecations-description",
    "message"
);
```

Based on the issue link each deprecation message is only triggered once per
request.

A limited stacktrace is included in the deprecation message to find the
offending location.

Note: A producer/library should never call `Deprecation::enableWith` methods
and leave the decision how to handle deprecations to application and
frameworks.

## Usage in PHPUnit tests

There is a `VerifyDeprecations` trait that you can use to make assertions on
the occurrence of deprecations within a test.

```php
use Doctrine\Deprecations\PHPUnit\VerifyDeprecations;

class MyTest extends TestCase
{
    use VerifyDeprecations;

    public function testSomethingDeprecation()
    {
        $this->expectDeprecationWithIdentifier('https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issue/1234');

        triggerTheCodeWithDeprecation();
    }

    public function testSomethingDeprecationFixed()
    {
        $this->expectNoDeprecationWithIdentifier('https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issue/1234');

        triggerTheCodeWithoutDeprecation();
    }
}
```

## What is a deprecation identifier?

An identifier for deprecations is just a link to any resource, most often a
Github Issue or Pull Request explaining the deprecation and potentially its
alternative.
