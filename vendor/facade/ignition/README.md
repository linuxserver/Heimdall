[Ignition](https://flareapp.io/docs/ignition-for-laravel/introduction) is a beautiful and customizable error page for Laravel applications running on Laravel 5.5 up Laravel 8. It is the default error page for all Laravel 6 applications. It also allows to publicly share your errors on [Flare](https://flareapp.io). If configured with a valid Flare API key, your errors in production applications will be tracked, and you'll get notified when they happen.

## Using Laravel 8 or above?

If you're on Laravel 8 or above, you can switch to [spatie/laravel-ignition](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ignition), which is a drop-in replacement.
Replace `facade/ignition` with `"spatie/laravel-ignition": "^1.0"` in your application's `composer.json` file.

Going forward, we'll only add security fixes to facade/ignition and highly encourage you to switch to spatie/laravel-ignition.

## Official Documentation

The official documentation for Ignition can be found on the [Flare website](https://flareapp.io/docs/ignition-for-laravel/installation).
