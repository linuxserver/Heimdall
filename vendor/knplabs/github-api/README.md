A simple Object Oriented wrapper for GitHub API, written with PHP.

Uses [GitHub API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3/) & supports [GitHub API v4](http://developer.github.com/v4). The object API (v3) is very similar to the RESTful API.

## Features

* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested and documented

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6
* A [HTTP client](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation)
* A [PSR-7 implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation)
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.

## Install

Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require knplabs/github-api php-http/guzzle6-adapter "^1.1"
```

Why `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`? We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/). Read about clients in our [docs](doc/customize.md).


## Using Laravel?

[Laravel GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub) by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell) might interest you.

## Basic usage of `php-github-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Github\Client();
$repositories = $client->api('user')->repositories('ornicar');
```

From `$client` object, you can access to all GitHub.

## Cache usage

This example uses the PSR6 cache pool [redis-adapter](https://github.com/php-cache/redis-adapter). See http://www.php-cache.com/ for alternatives.

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Cache\Adapter\Redis\RedisCachePool;

$client = new \Redis();
$client->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
// Create a PSR6 cache pool
$pool = new RedisCachePool($client);

$client = new \Github\Client();
$client->addCache($pool);

// Do some request

// Stop using cache
$client->removeCache();
```

Using cache, the client will get cached responses if resources haven't changed since last time,
**without** reaching the `X-Rate-Limit` [imposed by github](http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).
