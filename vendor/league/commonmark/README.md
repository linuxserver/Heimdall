![league/commonmark](commonmark-banner.png)

**league/commonmark** is a highly-extensible PHP Markdown parser created by [Colin O'Dell][@colinodell] which supports the full [CommonMark] spec and [GitHub-Flavored Markdown].  It is based on the [CommonMark JS reference implementation][commonmark.js] by [John MacFarlane] \([@jgm]\).

## üì¶ Installation & Basic Usage

This project requires PHP 7.4 or higher with the `mbstring` extension.  To install it via [Composer] simply run:

``` bash
$ composer require league/commonmark
```

The `CommonMarkConverter` class provides a simple wrapper for converting CommonMark to HTML:

```php
use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;

$converter = new CommonMarkConverter([
    'html_input' => 'strip',
    'allow_unsafe_links' => false,
]);

echo $converter->convert('# Hello World!');

// <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Or if you want GitHub-Flavored Markdown, use the `GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter` class instead:

```php
use League\CommonMark\GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter;

$converter = new GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter([
    'html_input' => 'strip',
    'allow_unsafe_links' => false,
]);

echo $converter->convert('# Hello World!');

// <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Please note that only UTF-8 and ASCII encodings are supported.  If your Markdown uses a different encoding please convert it to UTF-8 before running it through this library.

üîí If you will be parsing untrusted input from users, please consider setting the `html_input` and `allow_unsafe_links` options per the example above. See <https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/> for more details. If you also do choose to allow raw HTML input from untrusted users, considering using a library (like [HTML Purifier](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier)) to provide additional HTML filtering.

## üìì Documentation

Full documentation on advanced usage, configuration, and customization can be found at [commonmark.thephpleague.com][docs].

## ‚è´ Upgrading

Information on how to upgrade to newer versions of this library can be found at <https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/releases>.

## üíª GitHub-Flavored Markdown

The `GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter` shown earlier is a drop-in replacement for the `CommonMarkConverter` which adds additional features found in the GFM spec:

 - Autolinks
 - Disallowed raw HTML
 - Strikethrough
 - Tables
 - Task Lists

See the [Extensions documentation](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/customization/extensions/) for more details on how to include only certain GFM features if you don't want them all.

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is followed closely. Minor and patch releases should not introduce breaking changes to the codebase; however, they might change the resulting AST or HTML output of parsed Markdown (due to bug fixes, spec changes, etc.)  As a result, you might get slightly different HTML, but any custom code built onto this library should still function correctly.

Any classes or methods marked `@internal` are not intended for use outside of this library and are subject to breaking changes at any time, so please avoid using them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Support

When a new **minor** version (e.g. `2.0` -> `2.1`) is released, the previous one (`2.0`) will continue to receive security and critical bug fixes for *at least* 3 months.

When a new **major** version is released (e.g. `1.6` -> `2.0`), the previous one (`1.6`) will receive critical bug fixes for *at least* 3 months and security updates for 6 months after that new release comes out.

(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)

**Professional support, including notification of new releases and security updates, is available through a [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-league-commonmark?utm_source=packagist-league-commonmark&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).**

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Contributing

To report a security vulnerability, please use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with us.

If you encounter a bug in the spec, please report it to the [CommonMark] project.  Any resulting fix will eventually be implemented in this project as well.

Contributions to this library are **welcome**, especially ones that:

 * Improve usability or flexibility without compromising our ability to adhere to the [CommonMark spec]
 * Mirror fixes made to the [reference implementation][commonmark.js]
 * Optimize performance
 * Fix issues with adhering to the [CommonMark spec]

Major refactoring to core parsing logic should be avoided if possible so that we can easily follow updates made to [the reference implementation][commonmark.js]. That being said, we will absolutely consider changes which don't deviate too far from the reference spec or which are favored by other popular CommonMark implementations.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details.

## üß™ Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```

This will also test league/commonmark against the latest supported spec.

## üöÄ Performance Benchmarks

You can compare the performance of **league/commonmark** to other popular parsers by running the included benchmark tool:

``` bash
$ ./tests/benchmark/benchmark.php
```
