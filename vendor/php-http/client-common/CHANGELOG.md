### Added

 - Add an option on ErrorPlugin to only throw exception on response with 5XX status code.

### Changed

- AddPathPlugin no longer add prefix multiple times if a request is restarted - it now only adds the prefix if that request chain has not yet passed through the AddPathPlugin

- `PluginClientFactory` to create `PluginClient` instances.
- Added new option 'delay' for `RetryPlugin`.
- Added new option 'decider' for `RetryPlugin`.
- Supports more cookie date formats in the Cookie Plugin

### Changed

- The `RetryPlugin` does now wait between retries. To disable/change this feature you must write something like:

  return 0; 
}); 
```

### Deprecated
