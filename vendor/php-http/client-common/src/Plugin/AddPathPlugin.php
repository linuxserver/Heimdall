     * Adds a prefix in the beginning of the URL's path.
     *
     * The prefix is not added if that prefix is already on the URL's path. This will fail on the edge
     * case of the prefix being repeated, for example if `https://example.com/api/api/foo` is a valid
     * URL on the server and the configured prefix is `/api`.
     *
     * We looked at other solutions, but they are all much more complicated, while still having edge
     * cases:
     * - Doing an spl_object_hash on `$first` will lead to collisions over time because over time the
     *   hash can collide.
     * - Have the PluginClient provide a magic header to identify the request chain and only apply
     *   this plugin once.
     *
     * There are 2 reasons for the AddPathPlugin to be executed twice on the same request:
     * - A plugin can restart the chain by calling `$first`, e.g. redirect
     * - A plugin can call `$next` more than once, e.g. retry
     *
     * Depending on the scenario, the path should or should not be added. E.g. `$first` could
     * be called after a redirect response from the server. The server likely already has the
     * correct path.
     *
     * No solution fits all use cases. This implementation will work fine for the common use cases.
     * If you have a specific situation where this is not the right thing, you can build a custom plugin
     * that does exactly what you need.
