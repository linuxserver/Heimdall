# Change Log

## 1.5.2 - 2018-12-31

Corrected mistakes in 1.5.1. The different between 1.5.2 and 1.5.0 is that
we removed some PHP 7 code. 

## 1.5.1 - 2018-12-31

This version added new features by mistake. These are reverted in 1.5.2. 

Do not use 1.5.1.

### Fixed

- Removed PHP 7 code

## 1.5.0 - 2018-12-30

### Added

- Support for `nyholm/psr7` version 1.0. 
- `ClassDiscovery::safeClassExists` which will help Magento users. 
- Support for HTTPlug 2.0
- Support for Buzz 1.0
- Better error message when nothing found by introducing a new exception: `NoCandidateFoundException`.

### Fixed

### Changed

- Made exception messages clearer. `StrategyUnavailableException` is no longer the previous exception to `DiscoveryFailedException`.

- Added interface `Http\Discovery\Exception` which is implemented by all our exceptions

### Changed

- Puli strategy renamed to Puli Beta strategy to prevent incompatibility with a future Puli stable
