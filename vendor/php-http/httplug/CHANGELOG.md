## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2022-02-21

### Changed

- Enabled the `$onRejected` callback of `HttpRejectedPromise` to return a promise for implementing a retry
  mechanism [#168](https://github.com/php-http/httplug/pull/168)

## [2.2.0] - 2020-07-13

### Changed

## [2.1.0] - 2019-12-27

### Changed

- `Http\Client\Exception\NetworkException` no longer extends `Http\Client\Exception\RequestException`,
  in accordance with [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/)

## [2.0.0] - 2018-10-31

This version is no BC break for consumers using HTTPlug. However, HTTP clients that
implement HTTPlug need to adjust because we add return type declarations.

### Added

- Support for PSR-18 (HTTP client).

### Changed

- **BC Break:** `HttpClient::sendRequest(RequestInterface $request)` has a return type annotation. The new
signature is `HttpClient::sendRequest(RequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface`.
- **BC Break:** `RequestException::getRequest()` has a return type annotation. The new
signature is `RequestException::getRequest(): RequestInterface`.
