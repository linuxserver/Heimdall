# Change Log


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.13.0] - 2022-02-11

- Added `Formatter::formatResponseForRequest()` to allow the formatter to get context from the request to decide what of the response to output.
- Deprecated `Formatter::formatResponse()` in favor of the new `formatResponseForRequest` method.

## [1.12.0] - 2021-08-29

- Added support for adjusting binary detection regex in FullHttpMessageFormatter.

## [1.11.2] - 2021-08-03

- Support GuzzleHttp/Psr7 version 2.0 in the (deprecated) GuzzleStreamFactory.

## [1.11.1] - 2021-05-24

- Support GuzzleHttp/Psr7 version 2.0 in the (deprecated) GuzzleUriFactory.

## [1.11.0] - 2020-02-01

- Migrated from `zendframework/zend-diactoros` to `laminas/laminas-diactoros`.
   Users are encouraged to update their dependencies by simply replacing the Zend package with the Laminas package.
   Due to the [laminas-zendframework-brige](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge), BC changes
   are not expected and legacy code does not need to be refactored (though it is
   [recommended and simple](https://docs.laminas.dev/migration/)).
- The diactoros factories of `php-http/message` will return objects from the `Laminas\Diactoros\` namespace, if
   the respective classes are available via autoloading, but continue to return objects from `Zend\Diactoros\`
   namespace otherwise.

- Allow to specify the hashing algorithm for WSSE authentication.

## [1.10.0] - 2020-11-11

- Added support for PHP 8.0.

## [1.9.1] - 2020-10-13

- Improved detection of binary stream to not consider newlines, carriage return or tabs as binary.

## [1.9.0] - 2020-08-17

- Omitted binary body in FullHttpMessageFormatter and CurlCommandFormatter.
  `[binary stream omitted]` will be shown instead.

### Added

- New Header authentication method for arbitrary header authentication.

## [1.8.0] - 2019-08-05

### Changed

- Raised minimum PHP version to 7.1

### Fixed

- Fatal error on `CurlCommandFormatter` when body is larger than `escapeshellarg` allowed length.
- Do not read stream in message formatter if stream is not seekable.

## [1.7.2] - 2018-10-30

### Fixed

- FilteredStream uses `@trigger_error` instead of throwing exceptions to not
  break careless users. You still need to fix your stream code to respect
  `isSeekable`. Seeking does not work as expected, and we will add exceptions
  in version 2.

## [1.7.1] - 2018-10-29

### Fixed

- FilteredStream is not actually seekable


## [1.7.0] - 2018-08-15

### Fixed

- Fix CurlCommandFormatter for binary request payloads
- Fix QueryParam authentication to assemble proper URL regardless of PHP `arg_separator.output` directive
- Do not pass `null` parameters to `Clue\StreamFilter\fun`

### Changed

- Dropped tests on HHVM


## [1.6.0] - 2017-07-05

### Added

- CookieUtil::parseDate to create a date from cookie date string

### Fixed

- Fix curl command of CurlFormatter when there is an user-agent header


## [1.5.0] - 2017-02-14

### Added

- Check for empty string in Stream factories
- Cookie::createWithoutValidation Static constructor to create a cookie. Will not perform any attribute validation during instantiation.
- Cookie::isValid Method to check if cookie attributes are valid.

### Fixed

- FilteredStream::getSize returns null because the contents size is unknown.
- Stream factories does not rewinds streams. The previous behavior was not coherent between factories and inputs.

### Deprecated

- FilteredStream::getReadFilter The read filter is internal and should never be used by consuming code.
- FilteredStream::getWriteFilter We did not implement writing to the streams at all. And if we do, the filter is an internal information and should not be used by consuming code.


## [1.4.1] - 2016-12-16

### Fixed

- Cookie::matchPath Cookie with root path (`/`) will not match sub path (e.g. `/cookie`).


## [1.4.0] - 2016-10-20

### Added

- Message, stream and URI factories for [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim)
- BufferedStream that allow you to decorate a non-seekable stream with a seekable one.
- cUrlFormatter to be able to redo the request with a cURL command


## [1.3.1] - 2016-07-15

### Fixed

- FullHttpMessageFormatter will not read from streams that you cannot rewind (non-seekable)
- FullHttpMessageFormatter will not read from the stream if $maxBodyLength is zero
- FullHttpMessageFormatter rewinds streams after they are read


## [1.3.0] - 2016-07-14

### Added

- FullHttpMessageFormatter to include headers and body in the formatted message

### Fixed
