/**
 * A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
 *
 * Most `DoubleEndedQueueInterface` implementations place no fixed limits on the
 * number of elements they may contain, but this interface supports
 * capacity-restricted double-ended queues as well as those with no fixed size
 * limit.
 *
 * This interface defines methods to access the elements at both ends of the
 * double-ended queue. Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the
 * element. Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception
 * if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either `null` or
 * `false`, depending on the operation). The latter form of the insert operation
 * is designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted implementations; in
 * most implementations, insert operations cannot fail.
 *
 * The twelve methods described above are summarized in the following table:
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>Summary of DoubleEndedQueueInterface methods</caption>
 * <thead>
 * <tr>
 * <th></th>
 * <th colspan=2>First Element (Head)</th>
 * <th colspan=2>Last Element (Tail)</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td></td>
 * <td><em>Throws exception</em></td>
 * <td><em>Special value</em></td>
 * <td><em>Throws exception</em></td>
 * <td><em>Special value</em></td>
 * </tr>
 * </thead>
 * <tbody>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Insert</th>
 * <td><code>addFirst()</code></td>
 * <td><code>offerFirst()</code></td>
 * <td><code>addLast()</code></td>
 * <td><code>offerLast()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Remove</th>
 * <td><code>removeFirst()</code></td>
 * <td><code>pollFirst()</code></td>
 * <td><code>removeLast()</code></td>
 * <td><code>pollLast()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Examine</th>
 * <td><code>firstElement()</code></td>
 * <td><code>peekFirst()</code></td>
 * <td><code>lastElement()</code></td>
 * <td><code>peekLast()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 *
 * This interface extends the `QueueInterface`. When a double-ended queue is
 * used as a queue, FIFO (first-in-first-out) behavior results. Elements are
 * added at the end of the double-ended queue and removed from the beginning.
 * The methods inherited from the `QueueInterface` are precisely equivalent to
 * `DoubleEndedQueueInterface` methods as indicated in the following table:
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>Comparison of QueueInterface and DoubleEndedQueueInterface methods</caption>
 * <thead>
 * <tr>
 * <th>QueueInterface Method</th>
 * <th>DoubleEndedQueueInterface Method</th>
 * </tr>
 * </thead>
 * <tbody>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>add()</code></td>
 * <td><code>addLast()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>offer()</code></td>
 * <td><code>offerLast()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>remove()</code></td>
 * <td><code>removeFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>poll()</code></td>
 * <td><code>pollFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>element()</code></td>
 * <td><code>firstElement()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>peek()</code></td>
 * <td><code>peekFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 *
 * Double-ended queues can also be used as LIFO (last-in-first-out) stacks. When
 * a double-ended queue is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from
 * the beginning of the double-ended queue. Stack concepts are precisely
 * equivalent to `DoubleEndedQueueInterface` methods as indicated in the table
 * below:
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>Comparison of stack concepts and DoubleEndedQueueInterface methods</caption>
 * <thead>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Stack concept</th>
 * <th>DoubleEndedQueueInterface Method</th>
 * </tr>
 * </thead>
 * <tbody>
 * <tr>
 * <td><em>push</em></td>
 * <td><code>addFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><em>pop</em></td>
 * <td><code>removeFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><em>peek</em></td>
 * <td><code>peekFirst()</code></td>
 * </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 *
 * Note that the `peek()` method works equally well when a double-ended queue is
 * used as a queue or a stack; in either case, elements are drawn from the
 * beginning of the double-ended queue.
 *
 * While `DoubleEndedQueueInterface` implementations are not strictly required
 * to prohibit the insertion of `null` elements, they are strongly encouraged to
 * do so. Users of any `DoubleEndedQueueInterface` implementations that do allow
 * `null` elements are strongly encouraged *not* to take advantage of the
 * ability to insert nulls. This is so because `null` is used as a special
 * return value by various methods to indicated that the double-ended queue is
 * empty.
