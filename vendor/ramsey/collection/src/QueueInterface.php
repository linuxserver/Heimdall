/**
 * A queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in
 * order.
 *
 * The principal operations on the queue are the addition of entities to the end
 * (tail), also known as *enqueue*, and removal of entities from the front
 * (head), also known as *dequeue*. This makes the queue a first-in-first-out
 * (FIFO) data structure.
 *
 * Besides basic array operations, queues provide additional insertion,
 * extraction, and inspection operations. Each of these methods exists in two
 * forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
 * special value (either `null` or `false`, depending on the operation). The
 * latter form of the insert operation is designed specifically for use with
 * capacity-restricted `QueueInterface` implementations; in most
 * implementations, insert operations cannot fail.

 *
 * Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO
 * (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which
 * order elements according to a supplied comparator, or the elements' natural
 * ordering, and LIFO queues (or stacks) which order the elements LIFO
 * (last-in-first-out). Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is
 * that element which would be removed by a call to remove() or poll(). In a
 * FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue. Other
 * kinds of queues may use different placement rules. Every `QueueInterface`
 * implementation must specify its ordering properties.
 *
 * The `offer()` method inserts an element if possible, otherwise returning
 * `false`. This differs from the `add()` method, which can fail to add an
 * element only by throwing an unchecked exception. The `offer()` method is
 * designed for use when failure is a normal, rather than exceptional
 * occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity (or "bounded") queues.
 *
 * The `remove()` and `poll()` methods remove and return the head of the queue.
 * Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a function of the queue's
 * ordering policy, which differs from implementation to implementation. The
 * `remove()` and `poll()` methods differ only in their behavior when the queue
 * is empty: the `remove()` method throws an exception, while the `poll()`
 * method returns `null`.
 *
 * The `element()` and `peek()` methods return, but do not remove, the head of
 * the queue.
 *
 * `QueueInterface` implementations generally do not allow insertion of `null`
 * elements, although some implementations do not prohibit insertion of `null`.
 * Even in the implementations that permit it, `null` should not be inserted
 * into a queue, as `null` is also used as a special return value by the
 * `poll()` method to indicate that the queue contains no elements.
