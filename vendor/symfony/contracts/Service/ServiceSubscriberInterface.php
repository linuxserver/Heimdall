 * A ServiceSubscriber exposes its dependencies via the static {@link getSubscribedServices} method.
 *
 * The getSubscribedServices method returns an array of service types required by such instances,
 * optionally keyed by the service names used internally. Service types that start with an interrogation
 * mark "?" are optional, while the other ones are mandatory service dependencies.
 *
 * The injected service locators SHOULD NOT allow access to any other services not specified by the method.
 *
 * It is expected that ServiceSubscriber instances consume PSR-11-based service locators internally.
 * This interface does not dictate any injection method for these service locators, although constructor
 * injection is recommended.
